	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	<p>In this project, we learned a lot about implementing geometric modeling. It was very interesting seeing how code translates into
	smoother graphics and the different algorithms one can use to achieve higher quality images. We built Bezier curves using
	de Casteljau's algorithm, got a deeper understanding of half-edges and their various applications in manipulating triangle meshes, and
	implemented loop subdivision which took many of the other tasks we did and applied them to one function. This project was really
	educational for us because we were able to get more hands on experience with creating 3D images and manipulating their properties.
	It really felt like a jump from the first project in terms of what we were dealing with (2D -> 3D).</p>

	<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

	<p>The de Casteljau algorithm is a recursive algorithm that allows us to compute Bezier curves by computing linear interpolations
	on n-1 intermediate control points at a parameter t (n being the possible intermediate control points). We implemented it by
	iterating through all the points that were passed in and then appending all the linearly interpolated points to the end of a vector
	we made and then returning that vector to find all the control points and ultimately the overall curve.</p>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
	<p>The de Casteljau algorithm can be extended to 3D surfaces. There are two inputs to the algorithm: the n x n grid of control points
	and two parameters, u and v. In the 2D representation of Bezier curves from Part 1, there was only one parameter: u. In order to extend it
	to Bezier surfaces, we needed to consider the separable 1D de Casteljau algorithm. We split it up so that we evaluate a Bezier curve
	evaluated by u and then interpolating each of those points with parameter v in order to get the Bezier surface. Our implementation
	was exactly the same as Part 1 with Bezier curves. Additionally, we implemented the evaluate function evaluated the Bezier patch at (u,v).

	<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
	<p> We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by first taking a default Vector3D object at (0,0,0). Then, we iterated through all triangles adjacent 
		to the vector and for each triangle we took cross product of the 2 sides that stem from the current vertex, which results in a perpendicular vector
		that stems from the same vector. The magnitude of the resulting cross product vector is proportional to the area of the triangle, which makes it "area-weighted".
		We take the cross product vector for all triangles and added to the running Vector3D object, then took the unit normal vector of the resulting weighted vector 
		to define the vertex normal. The result is a much smoother "averaged" 3D surface, as shown below.

	<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge flip</h3>

	<p>We started off implementing our edge flip operation by taking a pair of triangles and labeling all the properties of them, such
	as their half-edges, faces, vertices, and edges. Now that we had all these properties labeled we just had to discern which one of the
	components needed to be modified in order to satisfy the edge flip operation. We can't say we had a very eventful debugging journey
	for this part. After carefully labeling everything and using the setNeighbors function to reassign what needed to be changed, the edge
	flip operation worked pretty well for us in the end.</p>

					<figcaption align="middle">After flipEdge operation</figcaption>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>


	<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge split</h3>

	<p>We started the split edge implementation the same way as flip edge - by first drawing out a diagram labeled with vertices, edges, halfedges, and faces
		of before and after the operation occurs and any potential new halfedges, faces, vertices, or edges that will be created. A handdrawn diagram of our 
	brainstorming process is shown below:</p>

		<table style="width=100%">

					<figcaption align="middle">Before and After diagrams for Split and Flip operations</figcaption>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<p>In the actual implementation, we retrieved all the Iters of the before split diagram first, and then created new Iters for objects that were necessary post split.
		Then we changed all the objects to new corresponding halfedge in batches (first all vertices, then all edges, then all faces) and then reset all halfedges to the corresponding
		neighbors. Because we reset every object (even those that were redundant and kept the same halfedge or neighbors), this made debugging a lot easier. We had some bugs in 
		not defining the after split diagram correctly (e.g. I labeled e5 as e3 and e6 as e2 in the original diagram) but after adjusting so all the new edges were created inside of the 
		diamond rather than on the outside, it fixed rendering issues.

	<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
	<p>Loop subdivision is a method to upsample a mesh (aka splitting triangles into smaller subtriangles) to result in a smoother surface.
		New vertices can be created on an existing previous edge and old vertices may change position to a new position, and the entire mesh 
		is connected with more edges and faces. This is accomplished by calling the split edge method on all old edges before upsampling, and then 
		calling the flip edge method to flip any new edges that connects an old existing vertex to a newly created vertex. 
		We stored intermediate new positions in edge and vertex objects respectively to reset the position in the end, and also adjusted the splitEdge
		method to label which created edges are "new" vs. "old". (see handdrawn diagram from part 5)
	</p>

	<div align="middle">
		<table style="width=100%">

	</div>

	In these meshes, loop subdivision seems to make sharp corners and edges much smoother, similar to the phong shading model from part 3
	but even more refined as you do more and more levels on the teapot. Similarly, on cube, sharp corners and edges are also smoothed. If we pre-split 
	some edges on sharp corners and edges after subdivision, we found that the resulting object is even more smooth at same level of subdivision.

	Finally, notice that in the above images the cube is slightly asymmetric when subdividing because the faces of the cube are not divided
	by an edge that is not completely symmetric with respect to other faces of the cube, and thus we can pre-process each face by splitting each edge across the face 
	such that it forms an "X" and is symmetric about the whole cube, the cube will subdivide symmetrically as shown below.
