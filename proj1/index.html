<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>We learned a lot from this project since it was our first time doing a project related to computer graphics. Implementing this rasterizer was a good
  first step into the world of graphics. We built many different levels of a rasterizer ranging from doing single-colored pixels to supersampling to laying a texture
  on various pictures including the Berkeley seal and a world map. This project was really enlightening for us because it gave me more insight onto something
  that we usually take for granted- computer generated images and textures. We learned a lot of interesting things from this project like implementing supersampling
  which allows for better clarity of an image or texture mapping which is not nearly as complicated as we once previously thought it would be.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

  <p>Our first step in this project was rasterizing triangles. We did this by using sampling methods that we learned in class. For this particular part,
  we checked to see if the center of a pixel was located withing the triangle outline and if it was, we would color it in. To check if a pixel was
  located inside the triangle outline, we had to calculate the line equations of the triangle. We then used point-in-line tests to determine whether the point
  in question did in fact fall inside all 3 lines of the triangle. We did this while checking both the clockwise and counterclockwise orientations
  of the vertices. Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of a triangle because in our rasterize_triangle, our two
  outer for loops iterate through the minimum X value of the triangle and the maximum X value of the triangle for the width. For the height it iterates through
  the minimum Y value and the maximum Y value of the triangle for the height. This is sampling every point of the bounding rectangle that the triangle resides
  in.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

  <p>In this task of the project, we implemented supersampling. Since supersampling is dependent on the sampling rate, we had to implement additional
  for loops in order to check inside each of the pixels based on how many times we wanted to sample them. Since all the subpixels are also
  squares, the <strong>number</strong> of subpixels in a pixel has to be a perfect square. Supersampling is useful because it provides a more accurate result
  than just sampling once. It provides a higher image resolution and reduces aliasing, acting as a 1-pixel box filter. As mentioned earlier, we updated the rasterization pipeline to
  account for sampling rates that are greater than 1 (but also have to be square values) which meant that we needed to calculate the sample points of each pixel
  based on the sampling rate rather than just using 1 (this was done by calculating a fractional distance from the side of the pixel coordinates depending on sample rate).
  Supersampling promotes antialiasing because it takes <strong>several</strong> color samples from a pixel and averages them
  to one color based on the location of pixel in the image. This provides a clearer image than having one color represent a whole image and increasing the risk of
  aliasing.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>
  <p>This is the modified robot that we made. In this image, this robot is more colorful and is doing a little dancey dance similar to a disco. We
    achieved this by modifying the arm and leg components by adding a rotation factor to the source code and we changed the color of the robot to make it
    look more lively. Super fun.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>Barycentric coordinates is a coordinate system for triangles such that a point within the triangle can be interpreted as a sum of 3 weights (alpha, beta, gamma) multiplied to some vertex value,
  where these weights are normalized (add up to 1) and represent the proportional distance to the 3 vertices of the triangle. Another way of interpretating this is
  to imagine what magnitude weights to put on the vertices of a triangle such that the coordinate inside is the center of mass of the triangle. Barycentric coordinates are super
  useful in color and texture mapping because the "weights" can be used to distribute a variety of things, such as RGB colors where each vertex of triangle represents a different color,
  or even used to average out a single 2D vector that represents a coordinate inside the triangle when each vertex of the triangle has a different corresponding 2D vector.

  Below is an example of smoothly blending the vertices of a triangle at a point inside the triangle, when the vertices of the triangle represent the colors Red, Green, and Blue.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Pixel sampling is a method of for each (x, y) screen sample, evaluating a color (aka the color value of a texture mapped to 2D plane coordinates) at that
  coordinate, and then displaying the color on the screen. More pixel saples per texel sample may lead to magnified pictures, while a single pixel sample for
  multiple texel samples may lead to minimized pictures. Nearest pixel sampling is simply mapping the screen coordinate to the nearest rounded texel coordinate
  and displaying the color at that texel coordinate. Bilinear sampling is more involved, taking the nearest 4 texture sample locations (forms a "square") and averaging the final
  color through linear interpolation both horizontally and vertically on the 4 points.
</p>

<div align="middle">
<table style="width=100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./images/nearest_bad.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
      <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling with 1 sample per pixel on Parrot</figcaption>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="./images/bilinear_good.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
      <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling with 1 sample per pixel on Parrot</figcaption>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>In the above pictures, bilinear sampling on the Parrot's eye clearly defeats nearest sampling (with supersampling rate 1 per pixel).
  The eye looks much more smooth and natural with bilinear sampling, while more rigid and distinct with nearest pixel sampling.
</p>

<div align="middle">
<table style="width=100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./images/nearest_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
      <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling with 1 sample per pixel</figcaption>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="./images/nearest_16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
      <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling with 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<div align="middle">
<table style="width=100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./images/bilinear_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
      <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling with 1 sample per pixel</figcaption>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="./images/bilinear_16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
      <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling with 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>In the above 4 pictures, we compare 4 png screenshots as specified in the write-up specs. You can see that there will be a large
  difference between nearest sampling and bilinear sampling when there are a lot of thin lines of contrasting colors. In these cases,
  nearest pixel sampling will produce jagged lines of stark colors, while bilinear pixel sampling will average the stark colors somwhat to
  create a smoother resulting image. This also works best when supersampling at only 1 pixel, as you can see on the 16 samples per pixel images there
  is a smaller difference between nearest and bilinear sampling as supersampling already provides much of the antialiasing effect.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Level sampling is the notion of using different mipmap levels on parts of images (where lower levels = higher resolution mipmap and higher levels=lower resolution mipmaps that average out colors from higher resolution)
  depending on where a pixel sample is on the corresponding texture map, in order to reduce aliasing of images of different depths and optimizing rendering speed. We find the mipmap level D by using the equation listed
  in lecture (taking the log of the max of the norm of a few derivative expressions). Then we implement 3 different types of level sampling - level 0, which is just equivalent to task 5 (using the highest resolution mipmap),
  nearest level sampling, which involves rounding D to the nearest integer mipmap level, and linear level sampling, where we compute the mipmap level as a continuous number (also known as trilinear filtering).
</p>
<p>The tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialising power between pixel sampling, level sampling, and number of samples per pixel is as follows:
  Bilinear pixel sampling produces an antialising power similar to supersampling (number of samples per pixel) which is better at reducing aliasing over techniques such as nearest pixel sampling or sampling 1 sample per pixel.
  However, supersampling is very computationally expensive as you sample more and more samples per pixel (increases runtime by a multiplicative amount), and also uses quite a bit more memory to store the intermediate colors.
  Level sampling remedies this and improves on bilinear pixel sampling by allowing lower resolution pictures in parts of images that don't need high quality, which improves runtime and only adds 1/3 more memory per texture.
  Combining bilinear level sampling, supersampling, and bilinear pixel sampling gives the ultimate antialising power but the effects are minimal compared to each technique in isolation for most pictures.

      <figcaption align="middle">L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR, 4 Sample per Pixel</figcaption>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Out of the above pictures, I would say L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR with 4 Samples per pixel has the best antialising effect</p>
