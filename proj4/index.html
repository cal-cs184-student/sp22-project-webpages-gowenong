	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	<p>In this project, we implemented real-time simulation of a cloth object using a mass and spring system. We built a grid of masses and springs,
		computed the physics of falling and colliding cloth (with itself and other objects) with physics equations, and finally added shaders to make
		our cloth complete with several cool textures.
	</p>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and Springs</h3>

	<p> </p>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h3>
	In part 2, we added a bit of physics to our cloth grid by computing the total force acting on each point mass (classic F = ma) as well as spring correctional forces.
	We then use Verlet integration to compute new point mass at the next time step, so the simulation can smoothly display the cloth drooping correctly. Within the Verlet equations
	we added a bit of damping to simulate loss of energy, and then finally we constrained position updates such that a spring's length between 2 point masses is at most 1.1x greater than
	its rest length so that the springs do not look super deformed. Next we experimented with changing some of the constant values on the 2-pinned cloth.

	<p> When changing the spring constant ks, a very low value made the cloth act very loose, flexible and almost "shaky", and when the cloth dropped it looked like water ripples. As we increase the
	constant to higher and higher values, the cloth becomes more and more stiff, almost like a flat board. One thing that I found interesting was when I tried to raise ks even more (500k), the
 	cloth starts to fold over itself, and spins like a tornado - not sure if that's the intended result </p>

	<p> Changing density from low to high had the opposite effect. At density = 1, the cloth seems very light and does not drop down very emphatically.
		Meanwhile, when density=100000, the cloth was very heavy and had a similar "vibrating" effect as low spring constant, with the difference being the
		cloth dropped down more at the pins (felt like it wanted to free itself downward from the pins). I didn't include screenshots here as they weren't noticeably
		more interesting than the spring constant ones.
	</p>
	<p> When changing damping, the springs oscillated widely differently. At 0%, the cloth swings back and forth erratically, and the cloth is very wrinkled
		as it plays. Meanwhile, when damping is at 1%, it looks like it moves in molasses - very slow, and very stiff. Screenshots of each in motion are shown below.

	<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h3>
	In section 5, we implemented Diffuse, Blinn-Phong, Texture Mapping, Bump, Displacement, and Mirror shaders using the GLSL language.
	This involved modifying .frag and .vert files, which together help create light and texture effects.

	<p>
		Shaders are programs that runs on GPU, takes in an input like texture files and transforms them into a 4-D vector that represents
		a vertex position or color. Vertex shaders transforms vertices' displacement and normal vectors. Fragment shaders are helpful after
		rasterization, computing color and shaded fragements for the final output, resulting in a textured, colored object.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Blinn-Phong shading model combines specular highlights (bright highlights representing reflection of light sources), diffuse reflection (shading independent of view direction),
		and ambient lighting (shading that does not depend on anything) to create really realistic lighting effects on an object. Below we adjust the ka, kd, and ks constants to output only ambient component, only diffuse component, only specular component,
		and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.

	<p> Below is a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth, one on the sphere, and displacement mapping on the sphere using texture_3.png (brick texture) for each.
		For the bump mapping, I used normal = 1 instead of 0.1 to make the texture stand out more

		</div>

	<p> Next, we adjusted the bump and displacement sphere shaders by changing the coarseness to -o 16 a -16 and -o 128 -a 128
		For the bump shader, it seems like these settings don't affect the texture very much (a little brighter lighting), but on the displacement shader we can
		clearly see the texture become less spikey and more spherical.
